    The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether or not the usage of the Go
    plugin API is feasible for just-in-time compilation of a query language
    intended for a high performance in memory data store. This evaluation is
    done based upon the criteria of the ease of usability, performance and the
    robustness of the resulting implementation. For sake of comparison the
    query language is introduced. The code a JIT would have generated for
    several heavy queries is handwritten and benchmarked agains the same
    expressions evaluated via the current tree walk interpreter. The paper
    explores the different possibilities for accessing the Go compiler, working
    with the Go plugin API and highlights several benchmarks comparing the
    performance of the new JIT compiler and the previous language evaluation
    implementation.

\chapter{Conclusion}

% TODO: introduction to criteria for coming to a conclusion

\section{Usability and Robustness}

% TODO: requires go toolchain -> bad and not robust, requires user interaction
% TODO: no support for windows -> excludes a large user base

\section{Performance}

% TODO: talk about compiler invocation cost
% TODO: talk about memory usage and runtime savings, introduce charts and
% tables to compare memory and runtime values: jit enabled/disabled

\section{Implementation Complexity}

% TODO: talk about code gen complexity
% TODO: talk about possible errors occurring in the code gen and how they are
% hard to debug in the resulting shared object

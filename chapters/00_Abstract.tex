    The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether or not the usage of the Go
    plugin API is feasible for just-in-time compilation of a query language.
    This evaluation is done based upon the criteria of the ease of usability,
    performance and the robustness of the resulting implementation. For sake of
    comparison a minimalist programming language is introduced. A tree-walk
    interpreter, a bytecode compiler, the corresponding virtual machine and a
    compiler for generating Go source code are implemented. The paper explores
    the different possibilities for accessing the Go compiler, working with the
    Go plugin API and highlights several benchmarks comparing the performance
    of the three aforementioned language evaluation implementations.
